# About
Voxel engine for mmorpg game and tools.

Includes behaviour tree based ai, a remote ai debugger, a voxel editor and a lot more. The scripting is lua based.

There is still a lot of stuff missing where we could need your help.

You can find some old and most likely outdated videos in my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbnJUW0d4tYvdmsJ-R6iUpA).

# Running the tests
The tests need a postgres database named `enginetest` and a user named `engine` with the password.... `engine` (you can modify them via cvars). If no OpenGL or OpenCL context is available, the related tests are skipped.
You can use the docker-compose files to set up your environment.
